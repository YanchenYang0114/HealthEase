# HealthEase
HealthEase is a SwiftUI-based iOS prototype designed to help older adults interpret and reflect on long-term physical activity data. Developed as part of an Honours research project, HealthEase supports accessible self-monitoring and behaviour change using step trends, gamified badges, and daily feedback.
